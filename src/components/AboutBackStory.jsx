              Yes, as I stated in my random facts and in the video above, I knew
              what I wanted to do by the age of 13. The short version is that I
              loved playing video games growing up and always had an interest in
              knowing how they were made. So, a small idea turned into me
              wanting to make my own video game.

              And after a few friends helped to fill up notebooks with thoughts,
              ideas, and drawings we quickly realized that we needed a website.
              Obviously, this was before the internet was filled with this type
              of knowledge readily available at your fingertips (Youtube,
              Facebook, and even MySpace weren't a thing yet). So, I was able to
              teach myself the basics and build something.

              Fast-forwarding, after graduating college with an associate's
              degree in digital arts, I made my way into multiple jobs. First
              starting out as a designer in the print industry for a small
              publication company. This was the start of many core
              understandings and played a key role in my thought process when
              thinking about design as a whole, especially when it comes to
              typography. After that, working my way into the development
              industry was a path that I created for myself based on one
              question that I still find myself asking, how does it work? This
              was the one question that started the passion I call my career.
